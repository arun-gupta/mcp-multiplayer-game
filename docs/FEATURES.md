# 🚀 Features Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the features and capabilities of the MCP Protocol Tic Tac Toe game.

## 🔄 Hot-Swappable Models

**The most powerful feature** - dynamically change which LLM each agent uses without restarting the game!

### ✅ Implemented Features

- **🔄 Runtime Model Switching**: Swap any agent's LLM mid-game
- **🏪 Model Registry**: Centralized registry of available models
- **📊 Performance Comparison**: A/B test different models for each role
- **⚙️ Configuration API**: REST endpoints for model management
- **✅ Model Validation**: Automatic compatibility checking
- **📈 Performance Tracking**: Monitor model impact on agent performance

### 🌐 Supported Models

**Legend:**
- ☁️ **Cloud**: Hosted models requiring API keys and internet connection
- 🖥️ **Local**: Models running on your machine via Ollama (offline capable)

| Provider | Models | Type |
|----------|--------|------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, **GPT-5**, **GPT-5 Mini** (default) | ☁️ Cloud |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | ☁️ Cloud |
| **Ollama** | Llama2 7B/13B, Llama3 Latest, **Llama3.2 3B**, Mistral 7B | 🖥️ Local |

> **Note**: Default model is `gpt-5-mini` for optimal performance and cost balance.

### 🎯 Use Cases

- **Performance Testing**: Compare GPT-4 vs Llama3 in strategy planning
- **Cost Optimization**: Switch between expensive cloud and free local models
- **Specialization**: Use different models optimized for specific tasks
- **Redundancy**: Fallback to local models if cloud APIs are unavailable

### MCP Protocol Logging

All agent communications are logged in structured JSON:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
  "agent": "Scout",
  "message_type": "Observation",
  "data": {
    "current_board": [["X", "", ""], ["", "O", ""], ["", "", ""]],
    "current_player": "ai",
    "move_number": 2,
    "available_moves": [...],
    "threats": [...],
    "blocking_moves": [...]
  }
}
```
